[title=INTRO-start]
Everything is gray.  
The world seems suspended, holding its breath.  
I walk, not knowing why, nor for how long.  
And then... a glimmer.  
A spark of color, fragile, almost shy.  
I feel that if I touch it, I might remember.  
I must find my memories.  
Before the world fades away completely

[title=souvenir-un-start]
A hot air balloon, tiny in the dull sky.  
As I look at it, a gust of wind rushes through me.  
The wind, the freedom, the thrill of the sky...  
I see my hands gripping a rope,  
my laughter carried by the clouds.  
I wasn’t trapped then.  
I was flying.

[title=souvenir-deux-start]
An old suitcase, worn and carelessly abandoned.  
I touch it, and the images return.  
Train stations, hurried departures.  
Whispered promises: “I’ll come back.”  
But I can’t remember if I ever did.

[title=souvenir-trois-start]
An inflatable balloon shaped like a heart.  
Bright red, trembling in the empty air.  
A spark of childhood, a party, smiling faces.  
Then the balloon bursts in the sky.  
And silence falls like rain.

[title=souvenir-quatre-start]
A large painting stands here...  
It shows an ancient temple bathed in golden light.  
I stare at it, and something within me awakens.  
I remember a real place — or maybe a dream.  
A place where I had hidden what mattered most:  
a treasure, not of gold, but of meaning.  
The temple was within me all along.  
It was my memory I had rediscovered.

[title=FINALE-start]
I stand at the center of this world,  
surrounded by the colors I’ve brought back to life.  
The hot air balloon, the suitcase, the balloon, the painting…  
each carried a fragment of who I was.  
Now I remember.  
I was never lost.  
I was finding myself.
